This is a project I made while learning how to use cursor AI. This is not a reflection of my skills. I was curious about how the Ai would build the app depending on the instructions I gave it. I did not do any coding for this project, I just guided it along.

I think it did a pretty good job, but I would not use it to build a production app.

I noticed the datastructuring is not ideal. also the data calls are not ideal.

The app works and I am actively using it to store my recipes.
